# Django Playground - Project Checklist

> **Living, breathing document** - Add tasks as discovered, remove obsolete items, check off when actually implemented. This should evolve constantly as the project progresses.

## 🏗️ Project Setup & Planning

- [ ] **Read all design documents** (README.md, DESIGN_DOC.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md)
- [ ] **Define detailed Phase 1 tasks** based on implementation plan
- [ ] **Set up development environment** and build process
- [ ] **Create test strategy** for validating migration from current to target API

## 📋 Phase 1: Core Architecture (MVP)

*Fill out detailed tasks after reading docs*

- [ ] **Create DjangoPlayground singleton class** 
- [ ] **Implement DOM scanning for data attributes**
- [ ] **Add batch package installation**
- [ ] **Migrate worker communication pattern**

## 🔧 Phase 2: API Completion

*Tasks to be defined as Phase 1 progresses*

- [ ] **Framework integrations** (React/Vue/Astro)
- [ ] **Memory management**
- [ ] **Performance monitoring**
- [ ] **Error handling improvements**

## 🚀 Phase 3: Advanced Features  

*Tasks to be defined as Phase 2 progresses*

- [ ] **Interactive playground widget**
- [ ] **Template validation**
- [ ] **Optimization and polish**

## 📚 Documentation & Testing

- [ ] **Update user documentation** to match implemented API
- [ ] **Create migration guide** for existing users
- [ ] **Test with real documentation sites**
- [ ] **Framework integration examples**

## 🎯 Release Preparation

- [ ] **Performance benchmarking**
- [ ] **Browser compatibility testing**  
- [ ] **Package and distribution setup**
- [ ] **Version 1.0 release**

## How to Use This Checklist

**This is a LIVING DOCUMENT** - treat it as your dynamic project brain:

1. **Add freely** - Discovered a new task? Add it immediately, don't wait
2. **Remove liberally** - Requirements changed? Delete obsolete items without hesitation  
3. **Check honestly** - Only mark `- [x]` when actually implemented and tested
4. **Break down ruthlessly** - Large tasks should become multiple small, actionable items
5. **Reorganize boldly** - Move items between phases, create new sections as needed
6. **Update constantly** - This should change with every work session

**Key principles:**
- **Capture everything** - Better to have too many items than forget something important
- **Stay current** - Remove items that no longer make sense, add new discoveries
- **Be specific** - "Implement feature X" → "Write function Y, add test Z, update docs"
- **Track reality** - The checklist should reflect actual project state, not wishful thinking

## Task Categories

Use these prefixes to categorize tasks:
- 🏗️ **Architecture/Core** - Fundamental system changes
- 🔧 **Feature** - New functionality implementation  
- 📚 **Documentation** - User guides, examples, API docs
- 🧪 **Testing** - Validation, browser testing, performance
- 🚀 **Release** - Packaging, distribution, deployment
- 🐛 **Bug** - Fixes for issues discovered during development

## Current Focus

**Next Milestone:** Complete Phase 1 MVP with working singleton pattern and data attribute support

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Read design documents thoroughly
2. Break down Phase 1 into specific implementable tasks  
3. Set up development environment for testing migration
4. Start with DjangoPlayground singleton class implementation

## ⚠️ Remember: This Checklist is ALIVE

- **Add tasks** the moment you think of them
- **Delete tasks** that become irrelevant
- **Check off tasks** only when truly complete  
- **Reorganize sections** as the project evolves
- **Update current focus** to match reality
- **Don't be precious** - this document serves the project, not the other way around
