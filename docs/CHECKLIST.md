# Django Playground - Project Checklist

> **Living, breathing document** - Add tasks as discovered, remove obsolete items, check off when actually implemented. This should evolve constantly as the project progresses.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Setup & Planning

- [x] **Read all design documents** (README.md, DESIGN_DOC.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md)
- [x] **Define detailed Phase 1 tasks** based on implementation plan
- [x] **Set up development environment** and build process
- [x] **Create test strategy** for validating migration from current to target API

## üìã Phase 1: Core Architecture (MVP) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] **Create DjangoPlayground singleton class** with static methods (init, render, cleanup)
- [x] **Implement DOM scanning for data attributes** (data-django-template, data-django-packages)
- [x] **Add batch package installation** to worker with batch operation support
- [x] **Migrate worker communication pattern** to support singleton architecture
- [x] **Update types and constants** for new API with comprehensive TypeScript support
- [x] **Create HTML test example** demonstrating new declarative API
- [x] **Export all new APIs** from index.ts for public consumption
- [x] **Build validation** - project builds successfully with rolldown
- [x] **Backward compatibility** - existing createDjango API still works

## üö® Phase 2: Production Validation (CRITICAL PATH)

**Focus: Real-world adoption over feature expansion**

### Priority 1: Package Ecosystem Validation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] **django-bird integration testing** - Install and validate core functionality works
- [ ] **django-crispy-forms testing** - Test form rendering and styling
- [ ] **django-tables2 testing** - Validate table components work properly
- [ ] **Popular packages survey** - Identify top 10 Django packages for documentation use
- [ ] **Package failure scenarios** - Test what happens when packages don't install/work

### Priority 2: Performance & Browser Reality Check (Weeks 1-2)  
- [ ] **Multi-example performance testing** - Test 5, 10, 20 examples on single page
- [ ] **Memory usage profiling** - Find breaking points and memory leaks
- [ ] **Cross-browser compatibility** - Actually test Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] **Load time benchmarking** - Measure cold start vs warm render times
- [ ] **Failure scenario testing** - What happens when Pyodide fails to load

### Priority 3: Documentation Site Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] **Real documentation examples** - Create actual package docs, not test files
- [ ] **Static site generator testing** - Validate with Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus
- [ ] **Package maintainer partnership** - Get django-bird or similar to test in their docs
- [ ] **Production error handling** - Graceful degradation when Django fails
- [ ] **Performance guidelines** - Document limits and best practices

### Priority 4: Production-Ready Polish (Month 2)
- [ ] **Memory management improvements** - LRU caching, cleanup mechanisms  
- [ ] **Error messaging for docs authors** - Clear debugging information
- [ ] **Performance safeguards** - Automatic limits and warnings
- [ ] **Bundle size optimization** - Minimize download impact

## üéÅ Phase 3: Enhancement Features (Post-Adoption)

**Only pursue after real-world adoption is proven**

### Framework Integrations (Nice-to-Have)
- [ ] **React hooks** (`useTemplate`, `useDjango`) - Only if React docs sites request it
- [ ] **Vue composables** - For VuePress and similar generators
- [ ] **Framework examples** - Integration guides for popular doc generators

### Advanced Capabilities  
- [ ] **Template validation** without full rendering
- [ ] **Advanced caching strategies** for complex sites
- [ ] **Developer tools** for debugging template issues

### ‚ùå Explicitly Deprioritized
- ~~Interactive playground widget~~ - Different product, use CodeSandbox instead
- ~~Analytics and monitoring~~ - Over-engineering for documentation tool
- ~~Astro/11ty specific integrations~~ - Declarative API already works everywhere

## üìö Documentation & Examples (Integrated with Phase 2)

### Priority Documentation (For Real Adoption)
- [ ] **Real package documentation examples** - django-bird, django-crispy-forms in action
- [ ] **Static site generator integration guides** - Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus setup
- [ ] **Performance and limits guide** - Best practices for documentation authors
- [ ] **Error handling and fallbacks** - What to do when templates fail
- [ ] **Data attributes reference** - Complete guide to declarative API

### API Documentation (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **DjangoPlayground API reference** - Complete method documentation
- [ ] **Migration guide** from createDjango (for existing users, if any exist)
- [ ] **Package maintainer guide** - How to add Django Playground to package docs

### Validation (Part of Phase 2 Testing)
- [x] **HTML test suite** with comprehensive examples
- [ ] **Real documentation site examples** - Working implementations with popular packages
- [ ] **Cross-browser validation results** - Compatibility matrix

## üéØ Release Preparation (Post-Validation)

**Only relevant after proving real-world adoption**

- [ ] **Production performance benchmarks** - Documented limits and capabilities
- [ ] **Cross-browser compatibility matrix** - Verified support levels
- [ ] **Package maintainer adoption** - At least 2-3 Django packages using it
- [ ] **Distribution and CDN setup** - Easy installation for documentation sites
- [ ] **Version 1.0 release** with proven track record

## How to Use This Checklist

**This is a LIVING DOCUMENT** - treat it as your dynamic project brain:

1. **Add freely** - Discovered a new task? Add it immediately, don't wait
2. **Remove liberally** - Requirements changed? Delete obsolete items without hesitation  
3. **Check honestly** - Only mark `- [x]` when actually implemented and tested
4. **Break down ruthlessly** - Large tasks should become multiple small, actionable items
5. **Reorganize boldly** - Move items between phases, create new sections as needed
6. **Update constantly** - This should change with every work session

**Key principles:**
- **Capture everything** - Better to have too many items than forget something important
- **Stay current** - Remove items that no longer make sense, add new discoveries
- **Be specific** - "Implement feature X" ‚Üí "Write function Y, add test Z, update docs"
- **Track reality** - The checklist should reflect actual project state, not wishful thinking

## Task Categories

Use these prefixes to categorize tasks:
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture/Core** - Fundamental system changes
- üîß **Feature** - New functionality implementation  
- üìö **Documentation** - User guides, examples, API docs
- üß™ **Testing** - Validation, browser testing, performance
- üöÄ **Release** - Packaging, distribution, deployment
- üêõ **Bug** - Fixes for issues discovered during development

## Current Focus

**üéâ MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** Phase 1 MVP Complete!

**‚úÖ Just Completed:**
- Full singleton pattern implementation with declarative API
- DOM scanning and batch operations working
- Comprehensive test suite and build validation
- Backward compatibility maintained

**üö® CRITICAL REALIZATION:** Need validation over features!

**üéØ Next Milestone:** Phase 2 Production Validation - Real-World Adoption

**Immediate Next Steps (This Week):**
1. **Test with django-bird** - Install and validate it actually works with popular packages
2. **Performance reality check** - Test with multiple examples, find breaking points
3. **Cross-browser testing** - Actually verify it works beyond Chrome
4. **Create real package docs** - Not test files, but actual documentation examples

**Why This Matters:** Technical foundation is solid, but real adoption requires proving it works reliably with actual Django packages in real documentation sites. Framework integrations are nice-to-have, not critical path.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember: This Checklist is ALIVE

- **Add tasks** the moment you think of them
- **Delete tasks** that become irrelevant
- **Check off tasks** only when truly complete  
- **Reorganize sections** as the project evolves
- **Update current focus** to match reality
- **Don't be precious** - this document serves the project, not the other way around
